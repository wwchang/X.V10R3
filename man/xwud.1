.TH XWUD 1 "27 July 1985" "X Version 10"
.SH NAME
xwud - X Window System, window image undumper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xwud"
[ -debug ] [ -help ] [ -in \fIfile\fP ] [ \fIhost\fP:\fIdisplay\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Xwud
is an X Window System window image undumping utility.
.I Xwud
allows X users to display window images that were saved in a specially
formatted window dump file.   The window  image  will  appear  at  the
coordinates of the original window from which the dump was taken.
This is a crude version of a more advanced utility that will be released
in the near future.  The window dump file format is currently under
development no guarantee of upward compatibility is made.
.PP
.B NOTE:
Windows dumped in `Z' pixmap format can only be undumped on a
color display!
.SH ARGUMENT SUMMARY
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-help"
Print out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-in \fIfile\fP"
This argument allows the user to explicitly specify the input 
file on the command line.  The default is to take input from standard in.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "\fIhost\fP:\fIdisplay\fP"
This  argument  allow  you  to  specify the host and display number on
which to display the window dump.  For example `xwud orpheus:1'
would specify that the dump will appear on display `1' on the machine
`orpheus'.  By default,
.I xwud
uses the host and display number stored in the environment variable
DISPLAY, and therefore this argument is not normally specified.
.SH ENVIRONMENT

.SH FILES
