.TH RESIZE 1 "3 January 1985" "X Version 10"
.SH NAME
resize - reset TERMCAP with current size of a window
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B resize
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIResize\fP prints on its standard output the TERM and TERMCAP commands for
the C-shell of the current size of a window.  It is never executed directly,
but should be aliased similarly to
.I tset
to cause the C-shell to execute the commands.
.PP
For example, the following alias when executed as a command will reset
the environment of the current shell:
.sp
	alias xs	'set noglob; eval `resize`'
.br
.SH FILES
/etc/termcap	for the base termcap entry to modify.
.br
~/.cshrc	user's alias for the command.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
csh(1), tset(1), xterm(1)

.SH BUGS
Ought to be able to generate the strings for the Bourne shell.
There should be some global notion of display size; termcap and
terminfo need to be rethought in the context of window systems.
