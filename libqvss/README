	I am not able to distribute source for the QVSS bit-blit code.
Included in this directory are the device dependent X routines which use them,
however, as an example of another ddX interface.

	To change the font location, edit ``vssite.h'', and recompile 
``ddxfontloc.c''.  Archive the resulting file into libqvss.a.
