.PP
The name of the executable built in the ``X'' directory for the is
Xsun.
.PP
Use under \fIinit(8)\fP is not supported.
Use \fIxinit(1)\fP instead.
See the caveats in the \fIXsun(8c)\fP manual page.
.PP
Be sure to rebuild \fIXsun\fP and \fIxterm\fP under Sun 3.0.

As the Sun version of X happened at the last possible moment,
its installation is not as smooth as one would like.
.PP
The top level \fIX/Makefile\fP has a ``make sun'' entry which edits out
an include of \fI<sys/types.h>\fP which should be executed on Sun 2.X
versions of the system.
You should remove the build of \fIinline\fP, \fIlibvs100\fP, and \fIxpr\fP
from the \fIX/Makefile\fP.
You must also edit out the use of ``inline'' in \fIX/Xlib/Makefile\fP,
which is a VAX specific optimizer.
