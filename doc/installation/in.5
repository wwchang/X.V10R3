Installation Under Ultrix-32 1.1
.PP
The name of the executable built in the "X" directory for QVSS is
Xqvss.
Note that some of the files mentioned here are only available on the
MIT distribution of X.
.PP
We recommend upgrading to Ultrix-32 1.2 as soon as possible.
When you do, be sure to rebuild \fIXqvss\fP and \fIxterm\fP.
.PP
If you need to relocate the font directory, 
edit the file \fIlibqvss/vssite.h\fP, recompile \fIlibqvss/ddxfontloc\fP,
and replace the file into \fIlibqvss/libqvss.a\fP using \fIar(1)\fP.
.PP
Note that the \fIXqvss\fP server and the \fIxterm\fP
executable should be recomiled
when you upgrade to 1.2.
A server built under 1.1 will not execute under field test two of Ultrix-32 1.2
or under version 1.2 release due to a system call
change.
.PP
The improved pty driver has already been installed, but the TCP problem
is still with you.
X will be slightly unreliable when pushed hard until you upgrade to Ultrix
1.2 when using the TCP domain on the local host.
Everything should run reliably if you run using the Unix domain.
(use a DISPLAY variable of \fIunix:0\fP).
The file provided should be added to your \fIBINARY.mvax\fP directory, and
your kernel rebuilt.
This will change the keyboard handling in the
shared event queue of the QVSS driver to match what this version of X requires.
.PP
In addition, the file \fIsys/vaxuba/qevent.h\fP should replace the file of that
name in \fI/usr/include/vaxuba\fP.
This file avoids the redefinition problems you would encounter with the
original.
The bit-blit code is not available in source.  There is an object
library \fIX/libqvss/libqvss.a\fP containing the object of the device dependent
library.
Note that you should not just \fIrcp(1)\fP the distribution tree, as there
are symbolic links in the tree.
If you have, you may need to \fIranlib(1)\fP the QVSS object library.
